# Migration from Supabase to SQLite + Local Storage - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Successfully migrated the application from Supabase (database + storage + auth) to SQLite (database) + local file storage (images) + simple authentication.

## Completed Steps

### 1. Install SQLite Dependencies ✅
- Installed better-sqlite3 and related packages
- Installed uuid for generating IDs
- Installed bcryptjs for password hashing

### 2. Create SQLite Database Setup ✅
- Created `src/lib/database.ts` with SQLite connection and schema
- Created database tables: users, crops, profiles, messages, orders, agroplan_data
- Added database initialization and migration scripts

### 3. Implement Authentication System ✅
- Created simple authentication without Supabase Auth
- Implemented user registration and login
- Added session management with localStorage
- Updated auth-related components

### 4. Create Database Service Layer ✅
- Created `src/lib/dbService.ts` with CRUD operations for all tables
- Replaced all Supabase queries with SQLite queries
- Handled data type conversions between SQLite and TypeScript

### 5. Implement Local Image Storage ✅
- Updated `src/lib/imageUtils.ts` for local file storage
- Created `public/uploads/crops/` directory for images
- Implemented image upload, retrieval, and deletion locally

### 6. Update All Components ✅
- Updated `AddCropForm.tsx` to use new database and storage
- Updated `CropCard.tsx` to use new database and storage
- Updated `FarmerDashboard.tsx` to use new database
- Updated `Auth.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx` to use new auth system
- Updated `DashboardNav.tsx` to use new logout system

### 7. Update Type Definitions ✅
- Removed Supabase types
- Created local TypeScript interfaces for database tables
- Updated all imports

### 8. Testing and Cleanup ✅
- Tested all functionality: auth, crop CRUD, image upload
- Removed Supabase dependencies and configuration
- Updated README with new setup instructions

## Migration Summary

- **Database**: Supabase → SQLite
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage → Local file system
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth → Custom auth with bcrypt
- **Dependencies**: Removed @supabase/supabase-js
- **Files Removed**: Supabase integration files, config files
- **New Files**: Database setup, service layer, local auth

The application now runs completely offline with local data persistence and file storage. Users can register, login, add crops with photos, and manage their listings without any external dependencies.
